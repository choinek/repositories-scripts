## Scripts<br />
<br />
### Text-Includer<br />
<br />
The **Text-Includer** is a flexible script designed to process text files with placeholders and replace them dynamically<br />
with content from other files. It is particularly useful for generating documentation files like `README.md` by<br />
including content from other files such as `LICENSE`.<br />
<br />
#### How It Works<br />
<br />
The Text-Includer script scans a source file for placeholders in the format:<br />
<br />
```text<br />
{{text-includer:v1:loadfile:&lt;file&gt;:&lt;start_marker&gt;:&lt;end_marker&gt;}}<br />
```<br />
<br />
- `&lt;file&gt;`: The file to extract content from.<br />
- `&lt;start_marker&gt;`: The marker in `&lt;file&gt;` where the included content starts.<br />
- `&lt;end_marker&gt;`: The marker in `&lt;file&gt;` where the included content ends.<br />
<br />
Example placeholder:<br />
<br />
```text<br />
{{text-includer:v1:loadfile:LICENSE:#1:#2}}<br />
```<br />
<br />
This placeholder will include the content between `#1` and `#2` in the `LICENSE` file.<br />
<br />
#### Installation<br />
<br />
**1. Install Choinek&#039;s Scripts:**<br />
<br />
<br />
(@todo i will put here curl to install after deploy to github pages - few minutes from now :P)<br />
<br />
**2. Run the Installer Script**<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
sh .choinek-scripts/install-text-includer-hook.sh<br />
```<br />
<br />
You will be prompted to enter:<br />
<br />
- The source file path (e.g., `README.md.source`).<br />
  - _Check_ [_Usage_](#Usage) _for more details._<br />
- The output file path (e.g., `README.md`).<br />
<br />
**3. Verify the Pre-commit Hook**<br />
<br />
The installer will create or update the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file to include the text-includer logic. It will:<br />
<br />
- Generate the output file (e.g., `README.md`) before every commit.<br />
- Ensure the placeholders in the source file are replaced with the correct content.<br />
<br />
### Usage<br />
<br />
#### 1. Prepare Your Source File<br />
<br />
Add placeholders to your source file using the format:<br />
<br />
```text<br />
{{text-includer:v1:loadfile:&lt;file&gt;:&lt;start_marker&gt;:&lt;end_marker&gt;}}<br />
```<br />
<br />
#### 2. Modify Referenced Files<br />
<br />
Ensure the referenced files (e.g., `LICENSE`) contain the markers and content to be included.<br />
<br />
#### 3. Commit Changes<br />
<br />
When you commit, the pre-commit hook will automatically generate the output file by replacing the placeholders in the<br />
source file.<br />
<br />
### Example<br />
<br />
#### Source File: `README.md.source`<br />
<br />
```markdown<br />
# Project Name<br />
<br />
## License<br />
<br />
{{text-includer:v1:loadfile:LICENSE:#1:#2}}<br />
```<br />
<br />
#### Referenced File: `LICENSE`<br />
<br />
```text<br />
#1<br />
This is the included license content.<br />
#2<br />
```<br />
<br />
#### Generated Output: `README.md`<br />
<br />
```markdown<br />
# Project Name<br />
<br />
## License<br />
<br />
This is the included license content.<br />
