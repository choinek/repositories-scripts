It is particularly useful for generating documentation files like `README.md` by\nincluding content from other files such as `LICENSE`.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nThe Text-Includer script scans a source file for placeholders in the format:\n\n```text\n{{text-includer:v1:loadfile:<file>:<start_marker>:<end_marker>}}\n```\n\n- `<file>`: The file to extract content from.\n- `<start_marker>`: The marker in `<file>` where the included content starts.\n- `<end_marker>`: The marker in `<file>` where the included content ends.\n\nExample placeholder:\n\n```text\n{{text-includer:v1:loadfile:LICENSE:#1:#2}}\n```\n\nThis placeholder will include the content between `#1` and `#2` in the `LICENSE` file.\n\n#### Installation\n\n**1. Install Choinek's Scripts:**\n\n\n(@todo i will put here curl to install after deploy to github pages - few minutes from now :P)\n\n**2. Run the Installer Script**\n\n```bash\nsh .choinek-scripts/install-text-includer-hook.sh\n```\n\nYou will be prompted to enter:\n\n- The source file path (e.g., `README.md.source`).\n  - _Check_ [_Usage_](#Usage) _for more details._\n- The output file path (e.g., `README.md`).\n\n**3. Verify the Pre-commit Hook**\n\nThe installer will create or update the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file to include the text-includer logic. It will:\n\n- Generate the output file (e.g., `README.md`) before every commit.\n- Ensure the placeholders in the source file are replaced with the correct content.\n\n### Usage\n\n#### 1. Prepare Your Source File\n\nAdd placeholders to your source file using the format:\n\n```text\n{{text-includer:v1:loadfile:<file>:<start_marker>:<end_marker>}}\n```\n\n#### 2. Modify Referenced Files\n\nEnsure the referenced files (e.g., `LICENSE`) contain the markers and content to be included.\n\n#### 3. Commit Changes\n\nWhen you commit, the pre-commit hook will automatically generate the output file by replacing the placeholders in the\nsource file.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Source File: `README.md.source`\n\n```markdown\n# Project Name\n\n## License\n\n{{text-includer:v1:loadfile:LICENSE:#1:#2}}\n```\n\n#### Referenced File: `LICENSE`\n\n```text\n#1\nThis is the included license content.\n#2\n```\n\n#### Generated Output: `README.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Project Name\n\n## License\n\nThis is the included license content.\n```",
